It's been a long time. Realized that I have really had little of a chance to do any personal development in some time. 
Decided my personal word for the year 2020 was going to be `STRONGER` and as part of that I was going to get stronger in
terms of personal development.

Spent some time and money purchasing some 'crash courses' with some new technology, and while going through that
technology, I wanted a sandbox to play with that. For that reason I have resurrected 
[DingoBytes.com](https://www.dingobytes.com/).

I don't expect to be updating this site frequently, but I would like to make more of an effort to put some cool things
that I have learned during this process on this site (and others) as I progress.

So **CHEERS** to a successful year of getting `STRONGER` in the year 2020.
