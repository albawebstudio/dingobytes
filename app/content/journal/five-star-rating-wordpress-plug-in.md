Thanks to some helpful critics and tips from users, we have taken our very first plugin and retooled it to be more flexible and easier to implement into your posts and pages.

If you used our previous plugin ([Contestant Rating WordPress Plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/contestant-rating/ "Contestant Rating WordPress Plugin")), you will be happy to learn that this new plugin is a great replacement.

1. **Use shortcode to display your ratings.** We have incorporated the use of shortcode into the plugin, so you are no longer required to edit your template.<br />
*Because it was our first plugin, we did not have the vision to incorporate this in the first iterations. We have done our homework, and thanks to the help of other great WordPress users, we have created methods to display the Five-Star Rating plugin, ‘Best of the Month’ and ‘Best of the Moment’ using a simple shortcode.*
2. **You set the cookie.**<br />
*We did two bad things with the cookie in the first plugin. First, we hardcoded it, and second, we set the expiration for one year in the future. Of course this worked for us, but we realize now that you might have other uses for the plugin. Therefore, we have added the ability for you to set your own cookie expiration for as little as 1 minute to 12 hours to 365 days (or more if you like).*
3. **Make it your own.**<br />
We originally ported over an existing WordPress plugin, and that plugin had more than one look. Unfortunately, we did not have the vision to plan for using more than one look. Well, not anymore! We have added the ability to theme this plugin as you see fit (more instructions on how to do this will follow). Currently, there are two themes, but we have added the flexibility into the plugin to allow you to theme it as you like. It is as simple as adding an attribute to your short code.
4. **Help us keep improving.**<br />
*If you run into an issue, would like to request a feature or just want to tell us what a great plugin this is, be sure to </em><a title="Five-Star Rating Forum" href="http://wordpress.org/tags/five-star-rating?forum_id=10" target="_blank"><em>post a note to us</em></a><em>. Of course, if you run into an issue, please don’t just say, ‘It doesn’t work!’ or ‘This plugin sucks’ as 9 times out of 10 the plugin is working fine and as we intended, but the plugin is not being implemented correctly. We like criticism, but please make it constructive.*

We have more work to do as far as documentation and such, but this was just so exciting, we had to get it out now. More will follow in the future.
